A direct 2D NotITG port of [HURG's Noteskin-Workshop-Enchantment-V2 project for ITGMania](https://github.com/HURG-IIDX/Noteskin-Workshop-Enchantment-V2/tree/main).

Check the 3D version [here](https://github.com/PoRa-dayo/NotITG-Enchantment-Noteskin-Workshop).

Welcome to the NotITG noteskin workshop for Enchantment! This is a fully customizable "build your own" noteskin suite based on the "enchantment" noteskin included with ITGmania. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. This is a direct port of the original Enchantment-V2 workshop which uses 2D sprites for arrows and mines. ***As with all other 2D noteskins, it will not work on some NotITG files, so it is still highly recommended to play with the 3D version instead.*** All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "Previews" folder.

# Installation
- Install the noteskin by copying the 2 folders inside the "Enchantment - NotITG Port" folder, and inside your NotITG game folder, paste them in NoteSkins/dance. These contain the base default variants of the Enchantment noteskin.

- In NotITG, when you select a chart, right before the chart is played, when "PRESS [START] TO CHOOSE MODS" show up, do that to get the option to select your noteskin.

*You can change your default settings for NotITG (including default noteskin) by going to the NotITG game folder, and open and edit Data/GamePrefs.ini.*

# Customization
*You will only be changing the "enchantment-custom-2d" folder.*

- Head on to the Customization folder and build your own customized noteskin. Keep opening the noteskin variant folders that you prefer until you eventually see the "enchantment-custom-2d" folder.
- Copy the "enchantment-custom-2d" folders.
- In the NotITG game folder, go to NoteSkins/dance folder, then paste the folders and replace files, then restart the game to apply the variant.

- If you like what you have built in the "enchantment-custom-2d" folder, feel free to duplicate the folder and rename it to whatever you want. That way you can save your custom build, and use the "enchantment-custom-2d" folder to customize a new one!
